## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Language Testing**: Generate cover letters in each supported language
2. **Industry Testing**: Test with job descriptions from different industries
3. **Tone Testing**: Verify tone changes reflect in output
4. **Version Testing**: Generate multiple versions and compare
5. **Learning Testing**: Edit versions and verify learning data stored

### User Acceptance Testing
1. Generate cover letter with default settings
2. Open advanced settings and configure options
3. Add company research

6. Edit a version and save
7. Generate again and verify learning applied

### Edge Cases
1. No API key configured (should use template fallback)
2. API error (should show clear error message)
3. Empty job description (should prevent generation)
4. Very long job descriptions (should handle gracefully)
5. Special characters in company name (should escape properly)

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

2. Mobile app version
3. Integration with job boards
4. Application tracking system

## Known Limitations

1. **API Dependency**: Best features require API keys
2. **Cost**: AI API calls have associated costs
3. **Language Quality**: Non-English templates may need native speaker review
4. **Learning Data**: Limited by user's editing volume
5. **Company Research**: Manual input required (no auto-fetch yet)
