# ATS Extension - Archived

**Date Archived:** 2025-10-06

## Status

This package has been **merged into the main extension** at `/extension`.

## What Happened?

The standalone Job ATS Extension has been integrated into the main AI CV & Cover Letter Optimizer extension to provide a unified experience. All ATS auto-fill features are now available as part of the main extension.

## New Location

All ATS code has been moved to:
- `/extension/src/ats/` - Core ATS functionality
- `/extension/src/ats/content/` - Content scripts for form detection and filling
- `/extension/src/ats/background/` - Background services (AI, crypto, request queue)
- `/extension/src/ats/lib/` - Shared utilities (storage, messaging, i18n, logger)
- `/extension/tests/ats/` - Test files

## Migration Notes

### Settings Migration

The extension automatically migrates old settings to the new structure:
- Old: `chrome.storage.local.settings`
- New: `chrome.storage.local.settings.ats.*`

All features from the standalone ATS extension have been preserved:
- âœ… Auto-fill for Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, SmartRecruiters, SuccessFactors, Workable, iCIMS
