.provider-transition-exit-active
.provider-card-transition
.provider-content-animated
```

## 3. ✅ Kullanım İstatistikleri Toplama (Usage Statistics Collection)

### What was implemented:
- **Usage Analytics Service** (`src/utils/usageAnalytics.ts`)
  - Comprehensive event tracking system
  - Provider usage statistics
  - Success rate tracking
  - Response time monitoring
  - Daily usage charts

### Tracked Events:
1. **CV Optimization** - Tracks each CV optimization with provider, duration, and success status
2. **Cover Letter Generation** - Monitors cover letter generation events
3. **Provider Switch** - Records when users change AI providers
4. **API Calls** - Logs all API interactions with response times
5. **Errors** - Captures and categorizes error events

### Statistics Features:
- **Overview Metrics:**
  - Total events count
  - Success rate percentage
  - Average response time
  - Most used provider

- **Provider Analytics:**
  - Usage count per provider (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude)
  - Success rate per provider
  - Visual bar charts

- **Event Types Breakdown:**
  - CV optimizations
  - Cover letter generations
  - Provider switches
  - API calls
  - Errors

- **Daily Usage Chart:**
  - Last 14 days visualization
  - Color-coded by success rate (green: 80%+, yellow: 50-80%, red: <50%)
  - Event count display

### Updated Analytics Dashboard:
- Time range selector (7, 30, 90 days)
- Export analytics data as JSON
- Clear analytics option
- Interactive visualizations

### How to access:
Navigate to the Analytics tab in the extension to view all statistics.

## 4. ✅ Auto-Fallback Özelliği (Auto-Fallback Feature)

### What was implemented:
- **Intelligent Failover System** (`src/utils/aiService.ts`)
  - Automatic fallback to alternative providers
  - Configurable fallback behavior
  - Fallback attempt tracking

### How it works:
1. **Primary Provider Fails** - If the primary AI provider (e.g., OpenAI) fails:
   - The service automatically detects the failure
   - Checks for available API keys for alternative providers
   
2. **Fallback Sequence** - Tries alternative providers in order:
   - If using OpenAI → tries Gemini, then Claude
   - If using Gemini → tries OpenAI, then Claude
   - If using Claude → tries OpenAI, then Gemini

3. **Fallback Tracking** - Each fallback attempt is tracked:
   - Success/failure status
   - Which provider was used
   - Response time
   - Metadata about the fallback

### Features:
- **Automatic Detection** - No user intervention required
- **Smart Selection** - Only tries providers with configured API keys
- **Performance Tracking** - Monitors fallback success rates
- **User Notification** - Logs fallback attempts for transparency
- **Configurable** - Can be enabled/disabled via `setAutoFallback(boolean)`

### Benefits:
- **Higher Reliability** - Reduces service interruptions
- **Seamless Experience** - Users don't notice provider failures
- **Cost Optimization** - Can distribute load across providers
- **Better Uptime** - Multiple redundant providers

### Example Scenario:
```
1. User clicks "Optimize CV" with OpenAI configured
2. OpenAI API returns 503 (Service Unavailable)
3. Auto-fallback activates
4. Tries Gemini with configured API key
5. Gemini succeeds
6. User receives CV optimizations
7. Analytics records: OpenAI failed, Gemini succeeded (fallback)
```

### Configuration:
```typescript
// Enable auto-fallback (default: true)
aiService.setAutoFallback(true);

// Disable auto-fallback
aiService.setAutoFallback(false);
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Structure:
```
src/
├── utils/
│   ├── aiService.ts (updated with fallback logic)
│   ├── aiProviders.ts (existing)
│   ├── usageAnalytics.ts (new)
│   └── __tests__/
│       └── aiProviders.test.ts (new)
├── components/
│   ├── AISettings.tsx (updated with animations)
│   └── AnalyticsDashboard.tsx (updated with new analytics)
└── styles.css (updated with animation styles)
```

### Integration Points:
1. **AI Service** - Enhanced with analytics tracking and fallback logic
2. **Analytics Dashboard** - Complete redesign with new statistics
3. **AI Settings** - Added smooth animations
4. **Storage** - Analytics events stored in Chrome storage

### Performance Considerations:
- Analytics events limited to last 1000 entries
- Efficient storage using Chrome's local storage API
- Lazy initialization of analytics service
- Optimized chart rendering for large datasets
