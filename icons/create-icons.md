# Icon Placeholder Information

To create proper icons for the Chrome extension, you need to create three PNG files:

1. **icon16.png** - 16x16 pixels
2. **icon48.png** - 48x48 pixels  
3. **icon128.png** - 128x128 pixels

## Recommended Icon Design

The icon should represent the extension's purpose:
- ðŸ¤– AI/Robot symbol (representing AI-powered functionality)
- ðŸ“„ Document/CV symbol
- âœ¨ Sparkle/optimization symbol

## Quick Solution

For now, you can use online icon generators or create simple colored squares:

### Using Online Tools
1. Visit https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload a logo or design
3. Generate icons in required sizes
4. Download and place in the `icons/` folder

### Using Image Editor
1. Open any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.)
2. Create a canvas with:
   - Purple gradient background (#667eea to #764ba2)
   - White robot or document icon in center
3. Export as PNG in three sizes: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128
4. Name them icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png

## Temporary Placeholders

Until proper icons are created, you can use simple colored squares.
The extension will still work, but custom icons are recommended for production use.
