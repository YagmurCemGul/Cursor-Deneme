## 🎨 Resolution Strategy

### Decision Matrix

| File | Main Branch | Our Branch | Resolution |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| GoogleDriveSettings.tsx | Modal approach | View-mode routing | **Kept ours** (more scalable) |
| SetupWizard.tsx | 4-step wizard | 5-step with validation | **Kept ours** (integrated) |
| i18n.ts | Wizard translations | Advanced translations | **Merged both** |

### Rationale

**Why we kept our implementation:**

1. **More Comprehensive** - Our setup includes 4 additional advanced components
2. **Better Architecture** - View-mode routing is more scalable than modals
3. **Integrated System** - All components work together seamlessly
4. **Enhanced Features** - Real API testing, health monitoring, video tutorials
5. **Better UX** - Full-screen views vs overlays for complex workflows

**What we gained from main:**

1. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated testing and deployment
2. **Enhanced Features** - Interview questions, talent gap analysis
3. **Better Tooling** - Storybook for component development
4. **More Tests** - Comprehensive test suite
5. **LinkedIn Import** - New data source integration
