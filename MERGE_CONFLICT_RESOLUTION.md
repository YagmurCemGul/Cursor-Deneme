# Merge Conflict Resolution Plan

## Conflicts to Resolve

1. `src/components/GoogleDriveSettings.tsx`
2. `src/i18n.ts`
3. `src/components/SetupWizard.tsx` (add/add conflict)

## Analysis

### Main Branch Changes
- Implemented a detailed SetupWizard with step-by-step UI
- Added ~80+ wizard-related translation keys
- Uses modal/overlay approach (`showWizard` state)

### Our Branch Changes
- Implemented comprehensive advanced features:
  - Enhanced Validation system
  - SetupWizard (our version)
  - HealthMonitorDashboard
  - VideoTutorial framework
  - InteractiveGuide
- Added 19 translation keys for advanced features
- Uses view-mode routing system

## Resolution Strategy

### 1. GoogleDriveSettings.tsx
**Decision:** Keep our implementation with view-mode routing
**Reason:** More scalable, supports multiple advanced components

**Changes:**
- Keep all our component imports
- Keep view-mode routing logic
- Keep all our state variables
- Maintain backward compatibility

### 2. SetupWizard.tsx
**Decision:** Keep our implementation, enhance with main's translations
**Reason:** Our wizard integrates with validation system and advanced features

**Action:** Rename main's version if needed, or merge best features

### 3. i18n.ts
**Decision:** Merge all translation keys from both branches
**Reason:** Both sets of translations are valuable

**Changes:**
- Keep all our advanced feature translations (19 keys)
- Add all wizard translations from main (~80 keys)
- Ensure no duplicates
- Total: ~99 new translation keys

## Implementation Steps

1. ✅ Abort current merge
2. ✅ Analyze both implementations
3. Create merged i18n.ts with all keys
4. Create merged GoogleDriveSettings.tsx
5. Handle SetupWizard conflict (keep ours, add main's translations)
6. Test the merge
7. Commit resolved version
