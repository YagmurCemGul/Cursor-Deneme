   - Case-insensitive text matching
   - Deep copy mechanism to preserve original data

### Files Modified (4)
1. 📝 **`src/popup.tsx`**

   - Created `handleOptimizationsChange()` to apply optimizations in real-time
   - Created `handleCVDataChange()` to handle manual edits
   - Updated all form components to use new handler
   - Updated draft save/load to include originalCVData

## ✅ Problems Solved

### Problem 1: Optimizations Not Applied to CV Data
**Before:**
- AI generated optimization suggestions
- Suggestions only highlighted in UI
- CV data structure unchanged
- Exports used original text

**After:**
- Optimizations automatically applied to CV data
- Real-time updates when toggled
- CV data structure properly modified
- Exports contain optimized text

### Problem 2: No State Management for Optimizations
**Before:**
- Only toggle `applied` flag
- No way to track original data
- Cannot properly revert changes

**After:**
- Original CV data stored separately
- Can toggle optimizations on/off
- Proper revert mechanism
- State persists in drafts

### Problem 3: Manual Edits Conflict with Optimizations
**Before:**
- No handling of manual edits
- Optimizations could become stale
- Inconsistent state

**After:**
- Manual edits clear optimizations
- Clear user feedback
- Consistent data state

## 🔄 Data Flow Architecture

```
User Action Flow:
─────────────────
1. User fills CV data
2. Clicks "Optimize CV"
3. AI returns suggestions
4. Original CV stored
5. User toggles optimization
6. applyCVOptimizations() called
7. New CV data generated
8. State updated
9. Preview refreshes
10. Export uses optimized data

State Management:
────────────────
cvData            → Current (possibly optimized) CV
originalCVData    → Pre-optimization baseline
optimizations[]   → List with applied flags

Optimization Toggle:
───────────────────
Toggle ON:  applyCVOptimizations(original, [...opts, {applied:true}])
Toggle OFF: applyCVOptimizations(original, [...opts, {applied:false}])
```
