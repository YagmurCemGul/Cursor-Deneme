# Chrome Extension: Job ATS Assistant

## Summary

This PR introduces a comprehensive Chrome Manifest V3 extension for automating job applications with AI-powered features. The extension provides smart autofill, ATS scoring, cover letter generation, and application tracking - similar to OwlApply functionality but with enhanced privacy and security measures.

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Smart Autofill**: Automatically fill job application forms with profile data
- ✅ **ATS Match Scoring**: Calculate 0-100% compatibility between resume and job descriptions
- ✅ **AI Cover Letter Generator**: Generate tailored cover letters using OpenAI GPT models
- ✅ **Application Tracker**: Kanban-style pipeline tracking (Saved → Applied → Interview → Offered → Rejected)
- ✅ **Job Description Extraction**: Automatic extraction and caching from job sites

### Supported Platforms
- Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, SmartRecruiters, SuccessFactors, Workable, iCIMS
- LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor
- Generic form fallback

### User Interface
- Full React SPA dashboard with routing
- Profile & Resume management
- Jobs & Tracker views
- Settings with adapter controls
- Options page
- Minimal popup with quick actions

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Least-Privilege Permissions
- ❌ Removed `<all_urls>` permission
- ✅ Specific domain allowlist for 11 ATS platforms only
- ✅ Content Security Policy: `script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'`
- ✅ Adapter enable/disable toggles in settings
- ✅ Programmatic content script injection

### Privacy-First Design
- ✅ All data stored locally (Chrome Storage + IndexedDB)
- ✅ No external servers or data collection
- ✅ Optional AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2
- ✅ Zero telemetry or analytics
- ✅ API key stored locally, never transmitted to us
- ✅ Comprehensive PRIVACY.md included

### Safety Features
- ✅ Forms never auto-submitted (user must review)
- ✅ File uploads require manual action (browser security)
- ✅ MutationObserver cleanup on page unload
- ✅ Debug logging toggle (off by default)

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Build System**: Vite 5 + @crxjs/vite-plugin
- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript 5
- **Routing**: React Router v6 (Hash routing)
- **Storage**: Chrome Storage API + IndexedDB (idb)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API with streaming support
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (e2e)

### Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ ESLint configured
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Logger utility with levels
- ✅ Type-safe storage APIs

### Build Output
- **Size**: ~404 KB (gzipped: ~82 KB)
- **Files**: 31 files in dist/
- **Artifacts**: Service worker, content scripts, dashboard, options, popup, icons

## 📊 Testing

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Field detector tests (label/placeholder/aria matching)
- ✅ Form filler tests (event triggering, React compatibility)
- ✅ JD extraction tests (LinkedIn, Indeed, Workday fixtures)
- ✅ ATS score tests (TF-IDF, Jaccard, keyword extraction)

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
- ✅ Autofill smoke test with fixtures
- ⚠️ Manual testing required on real ATS sites

## 🚀 Deployment

### Development
```bash
cd packages/job-ats-extension
pnpm install
pnpm build
# Load unpacked: chrome://extensions/ → Load unpacked → dist/
```

### Testing Steps
1. Load extension in Chrome
2. Open dashboard (click extension icon)
3. Complete profile setup
4. Add OpenAI API key (optional, for AI features)
5. Navigate to a job posting (e.g., LinkedIn, Greenhouse)
6. Press `Ctrl+Shift+A` to autofill
7. Verify fields populated correctly
8. Check ATS score (`Ctrl+Shift+M`)
9. Generate cover letter
10. Track application in Tracker

### Chrome Web Store Submission (Future)
- Review `STORE_LISTING.md` for submission template
- Capture screenshots (7 required)
- Prepare promotional images
- Review PRIVACY.md
- Submit for review

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

1. **File Uploads**: Cannot be programmatically filled (browser security). Field is highlighted for manual action.
2. **PNG Icons**: Using SVG fallback. Sharp requires native compilation not available in this environment.
3. **E2E Tests**: Need real ATS environment for comprehensive testing.

## 🔄 Migration Impact

### Workspace Changes
- ✅ Added `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with `packages/*` pattern
- ✅ Updated root `package.json` with workspace scripts
- ✅ Added `.github/workflows/extension.yml` CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` for extension artifacts

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing project
- ✅ Extension is isolated in `packages/job-ats-extension/`
- ✅ Can be built/tested independently
