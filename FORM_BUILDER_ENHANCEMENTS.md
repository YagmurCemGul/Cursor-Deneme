## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Type Safety:
- All TypeScript types properly extended
- Conditional property spreading for optional fields
- Type guards for answer validation
- Proper handling of union types (string | string[])

### Performance:
- Debounced auto-save prevents excessive operations
- Efficient React hooks usage
- Minimal re-renders with proper state management
- Optimized file reading with FileReader API

### Validation:
```typescript
const validateAnswer = (question: CustomQuestion): boolean => {
  if (!question.required) return true;
  
  if (question.type === 'checkbox') {
    return Array.isArray(question.answer) && question.answer.length > 0;
  } else if (question.type === 'file_upload') {
    return !!question.fileData;
  } else {
    return typeof question.answer === 'string' && question.answer.trim() !== '';
  }
};
```

### Auto-save Implementation:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (autoSaveTimeoutRef.current) {
    clearTimeout(autoSaveTimeoutRef.current);
  }

  if (questions.length > 0) {
    autoSaveTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
      setAutoSaveMessage(t(language, 'questions.autoSaved'));
      setTimeout(() => setAutoSaveMessage(''), 2000);
    }, 1000);
  }

  return () => {
    if (autoSaveTimeoutRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(autoSaveTimeoutRef.current);
    }
  };
}, [questions, language]);
```

## üìä Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist:
1. **Validation:**
   - [ ] Create required question, leave empty, verify error appears
   - [ ] Fill required field, verify error disappears
   - [ ] Test all question types (text, checkbox, file, etc.)

2. **Character Counter:**
   - [ ] Create form_group with 100 char limit
   - [ ] Type 90 characters, verify counter shows "10 remaining"
   - [ ] Type 110 characters, verify shows "10 over limit" in red
   - [ ] Test with fieldset as well

3. **Auto-save:**
   - [ ] Add question, wait 1 second, verify "Auto-saved" message
   - [ ] Message should disappear after 2 seconds
   - [ ] Type rapidly, verify only one auto-save occurs

4. **Rich Text Editor:**
   - [ ] Create form_group question
   - [ ] Test bold, italic, bullets, numbered lists
   - [ ] Paste formatted content from Word/Google Docs
   - [ ] Verify character limit works with rich text

5. **File Upload:**
   - [ ] Upload file under 10MB, verify success
   - [ ] Try to upload file over 10MB, verify error
   - [ ] Change uploaded file
   - [ ] Remove uploaded file
   - [ ] Test required file upload validation

## üêõ Known Issues / Pre-existing Errors

The following TypeScript errors existed before these changes and are not related to the new features:
- `popup.tsx` line 245, 268: undefined state handling

- `JobDescriptionInput.tsx` line 31: category field type issue
- `JobDescriptionLibrary.tsx` line 60: category field type issue
- `ProfileManager.tsx` line 30: unused variable

These can be addressed separately as they don't affect the new form builder features.
